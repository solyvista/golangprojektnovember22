# golangprojektnovember22
this is a small golang project. i wrote a cowsay (with a pinguin instead of a cow). the program prints a function that "draws" a pinguin. one can scan input from the terminal via a scan function. the size of the speaking bubble of the pinguin is depended on the lenght of the input from the scanner.
